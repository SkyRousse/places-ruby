# Places Ruby

Make a website where you can enter places that you have been. Test and build methods to add places, save places, display all of the places you've added.

Don't forget to start by writing unit specs and making them pass before starting on integration testing and Sinatra. Also, there are starting to be more paths through your site. Make sure your integration tests cover all the ways a user may navigate through your pages!
